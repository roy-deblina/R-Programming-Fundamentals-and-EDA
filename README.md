# Foundational R Programming and Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository demonstrates a solid foundation in R programming, covering essential concepts from basic data structures to function development and introductory data analysis. The project works through a series of exercises designed to build core competency in R for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical exploration.

## Key Concepts & Skills Demonstrated
### 1. Vector Manipulation and Data Structures
Vector Creation: Created complex vectors using sequences, repetition (rep()), and arithmetic operations.

Data Manipulation: Performed sorting, subsetting, and element-wise vector arithmetic to transform and analyze data structures.

Indexing: Utilized indexing to extract and reconstruct vectors, demonstrating a core understanding of R's data structures.

### 2. User-Defined Functions & Numerical Problems
Function Development: Wrote a user-defined function to implement a trigonometric expression, showcasing the ability to create reusable code.

Numerical Analysis: Programmatically found the maximum value of a function over a given interval and identified the point of intersection between two curves.

Data Visualization: Plotted functions using Base R graphics, annotating key features like maxima and intersection points to visually communicate results.

### 3. Data Frame Handling & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Loading & Inspection: Loaded and inspected the structure of the built-in trees dataset using data() and str().

Summarization with apply(): Used the apply() function to efficiently compute summary statistics (medians) across all columns of a data frame.

Logical Subsetting: Extracted specific rows from a data frame based on logical conditions.

Feature Engineering: Calculated new variables (radius, area) from existing data to facilitate further analysis.

EDA Plots: Generated a variety of exploratory plots, including stem-and-leaf plots, histograms, and notched boxplots to understand the distribution of variables.

### 4. Statistical Distributions
Random Data Generation: Generated random samples from both the exponential (rexp()) and normal (rnorm()) distributions.

Comparative Analysis: Compared the characteristics of a right-skewed distribution (exponential) and a symmetric distribution (normal) using histograms, boxplots, and QQ plots.

Outlier Detection: Used boxplot.stats() to programmatically identify outliers and demonstrated the difference between standard and extreme outliers.
